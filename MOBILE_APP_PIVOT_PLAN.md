## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **BACKEND API EXTENSIONS:**

**New Endpoints:**
```python
# WebSocket for real-time voice streaming
/ws/voice/{user_id}

# Mobile app authentication
POST /api/mobile/auth/login
POST /api/mobile/auth/register

# Push notifications
POST /api/mobile/notifications/register-device
POST /api/mobile/notifications/send

# Mobile-optimized data

```

**WebSocket Voice Handler:**
```python
@router.websocket("/ws/voice/{user_id}")
async def voice_websocket(websocket: WebSocket, user_id: str):
    await websocket.accept()
    
    # Real-time audio streaming
    while True:
        audio_data = await websocket.receive_bytes()
        
        # Process with OpenAI Realtime
        response = await process_voice_stream(audio_data, user_id)
        
        # Send back audio + structured data
        await websocket.send_json({
            "audio": base64_audio_response,
            "action": "appointment_created",
            "data": appointment_details
        })
```

### **REACT NATIVE IMPLEMENTATION:**

**Voice Recording Component:**
```typescript
import { Audio } from 'expo-av';

const VoiceRecorder = () => {
  const [recording, setRecording] = useState<Audio.Recording>();
  const [isStreaming, setIsStreaming] = useState(false);

  const startVoiceStream = async () => {
    const { status } = await Audio.requestPermissionsAsync();
    if (status !== 'granted') return;

    const recording = new Audio.Recording();
    await recording.prepareToRecordAsync({
      android: {
        extension: '.wav',
        outputFormat: Audio.RECORDING_OPTION_ANDROID_OUTPUT_FORMAT_PCM_16BIT,
        audioEncoder: Audio.RECORDING_OPTION_ANDROID_AUDIO_ENCODER_PCM_16BIT,
        sampleRate: 24000,
        numberOfChannels: 1,
      },
      ios: {
        extension: '.wav',
        audioQuality: Audio.RECORDING_OPTION_IOS_AUDIO_QUALITY_HIGH,
        sampleRate: 24000,
        numberOfChannels: 1,
        bitRate: 384000,
        linearPCMBitDepth: 16,
        linearPCMIsBigEndian: false,
        linearPCMIsFloat: false,
      },
    });

    await recording.startAsync();
    setRecording(recording);

    // Stream chunks to backend via WebSocket
    streamAudioToBackend(recording);
  };
};
```

**WebSocket Integration:**
```typescript
const useVoiceWebSocket = (userId: string) => {
  const ws = useRef<WebSocket>();

  const connect = () => {
    ws.current = new WebSocket(`wss://your-app.railway.app/ws/voice/${userId}`);
    
    ws.current.onmessage = (event) => {
      const response = JSON.parse(event.data);
      
      // Play audio response
      playAudioResponse(response.audio);
      
      // Handle structured data (appointments, etc.)
      if (response.action === 'appointment_created') {
        updateLocalCalendar(response.data);
        showNotification('Appointment confirmed!');
      }
    };
  };

  const sendAudioChunk = (audioData: ArrayBuffer) => {
    if (ws.current?.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
      ws.current.send(audioData);
    }
  };

  return { connect, sendAudioChunk };
};
```
